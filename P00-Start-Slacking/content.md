## What we're building
If you've been attending Make School for any amount of time now, you should be very acquainted with the chat program Slack.

This live messaging app along with its gaming brother Discord, rely heavily on realtime communication.

In this tutorial we're going to be building our very own live messaging application.

## User Stories
1. Upon entering the application, I can choose a username to go by.
2. I can join / create chat channels.
3. I can direct message other existing users
4. I will never have to refresh the page to receive new data (messages)

## This sounds impossible
And it certainly would be next to impossible... if it weren't for socket.io!
