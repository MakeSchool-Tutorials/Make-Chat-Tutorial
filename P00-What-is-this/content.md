## Quick Summary
Socket.io is a realtime engine that is implemented on the server and client.

Some types of applications that use socket.io are the following:

1. Live Messaging / Chat Rooms
2. Realtime Data Analytics
3. Multiplayer Games such as Agar.io or Slither.io
4. The application you're going to make.

## But how does it work?
Socket.io uses a special protocol called WebSocket, which allows for the realtime communication between a web server and a web client.

**Please** do not try to understand WebSocket as Socket.io does not expect you to know jack about it.

You can think of Socket.io as a simple wrapper for the complex WebSocket, with some more spicy features included.

## No, I must learn WebSocket.
Okay smart guy, knock yourself [out](https://hpbn.co/websocket/).

## I give up... ðŸ˜¢
That's the spirit! You are now ready to move on and make your first Socket.io application!
